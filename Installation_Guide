This guide was made in lieu of an automated powershell script.  Changing execution policies for powershell scripts
is relatively difficult, and opens up the machine to potentially malicious vulnerabilities.

This assumes you already have Python installed on the system, and it is added as an environment variable to PATH.
Simply run main.py as if you were attempting to use it normally, from cmd.exe or powershell:

In the directory in which main.py is located:

> python .\main.py

If the libraries are missing for running this program are not installed, you may see an error of the form:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ".\main.py", line 5, in <module>
    from storedData import StoredData
  File "C:\Users\vorce\PycharmProjects\pythonProject\storedData.py", line 1, in <module>
    import numpy as np
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'numpy'

From here, you can use the Preferred Installer Program (pip) that comes bundled with Python:

> pip install <module name>

So, for the above error:

> pip install numpy

Continue attempting to run

> python .\main.py

And use pip to install any missing dependencies until the program runs without error.
